# We have a list of integers, where:

#   1. The integers are in the range 1..n
#   2. The list has a length n + 1

# It follows that our list has at least one integer which appears at least twice.
# But it may have several duplicates, and each duplicate may appear more than twice.

# Write a function which finds an integer that appears more than once in our list.
# (If there are multiple duplicates, you only need to find one of them.)

# We're going to run this function on our new, super-hip MacBook Pro With Retina Displayâ„¢.
# Thing is, the damn thing came with the RAM soldered right to the motherboard, so we
# can't upgrade our RAM. So we need to optimize for space!
